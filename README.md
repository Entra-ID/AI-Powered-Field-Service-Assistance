# AI-# AI-Powered Assistance App for Field Service Engineers

## Overview
The AI-Powered Assistance App is designed to revolutionize the field service engineering industry by providing engineers with instant access to complex documentation through an intuitive interface powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This app aims to reduce the time spent on diagnosing issues and increase overall efficiency.

## Features
- **Instant Information Retrieval**: Quickly find information within extensive technical documents using natural language queries.
- **Intelligent Diagnosis**: The app provides accurate diagnostics and actionable solutions for a wide range of technical issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and straightforward UI allows engineers to navigate the app with ease.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures that all proprietary data is handled securely, adhering to industry standards.**Integration with Existing Systems**: Seamlessly integrates with Databricks and other cloud services for robust performance.

## How It Works
The app leverages a fine-tuned LLM to understand and process the technical language found in engineering documents. When a query is inputted, the model retrieves the most relevant information and presents it in an easily digestible format.
